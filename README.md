# 🌆 Blade Runner 2049 – Environment Study (Unreal Engine 5)

A **cinematic environment project** built in **Unreal Engine 5**, inspired by the visual language, atmosphere, and scale of *Blade Runner 2049*. This project focuses on **mood, lighting, composition, and world-building**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Capture **Blade Runner–style atmosphere**: fog, haze, scale, silence
* Practice **cinematic lighting** using UE5
* Build a believable **sci‑fi environment** without relying on gameplay mechanics
* Learn environment storytelling through **composition, color, and lighting**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5
* **Rendering:** Lumen (Global Illumination + Reflections)
* **Geometry:** Nanite‑enabled assets
* **Lighting:** Fully dynamic lighting (no baked lights)
* **Camera:** Cinematic Camera Actor
* **Post‑Processing:** Heavy color grading, bloom, fog, and contrast tuning

---

## 🌫️ Environment Features

* Large‑scale desert / wasteland environment
* Strong **orange–yellow color palette** inspired by Blade Runner 2049
* Volumetric fog and atmospheric perspective for depth
* Minimalist composition to emphasize isolation
* Cinematic framing designed for stills and sequences

✅ Lighting and mood pass completed  
✅ Cinematic cameras set up  
🔧 Additional shots ongoing

## 📁 Repository Notes

* Large files handled via **Git LFS**
* Project uses default UE5 folder structure
* Optimized for cinematic rendering, not real‑time gameplay
