# 🌆 Blade Runner 2049 – Environment Study (Unreal Engine 5)

A cinematic environment project built in **Unreal Engine 5**, inspired by the visual language and atmosphere of *Blade Runner 2049*.  
This project explores **scale, isolation, and architectural oppression** through lighting, composition, and controlled color palettes.

The environments are designed to communicate emotion visually, with minimal reliance on props or narrative elements.

---

## 🎯 Project Intent

The core intent of this project is to portray **human insignificance within monumental spaces**.

Key themes explored:
- Isolation through scale
- Silence and emptiness as narrative tools
- Architectural dominance over the human form
- Mood driven primarily by lighting and atmosphere

Each scene is composed to feel deliberate, restrained, and oppressive rather than decorative.

## 🌫️ Scene Breakdown

### 1. Monumental Interior Space
A vast architectural chamber defined by repetition, symmetry, and vertical scale.

- Emphasis on **geometric rhythm** and depth
- Human silhouette used purely as a scale reference
- Directional light carving through darkness to guide the eye
- Minimal material variation to reinforce sterility and oppression

This scene establishes the tone of authority and insignificance.

### 2. Desert Wasteland
An expansive exterior environment dominated by a monochromatic orange palette.

- Heavy atmospheric perspective to create depth
- Strong silhouette readability against the horizon
- Minimal environmental detail to reinforce loneliness
- Scale conveyed through negative space rather than objects

This scene focuses on emotional emptiness rather than visual complexity.

### 3. Sculptural Forms in the Wasteland
Large abstract sculptural figures framing a distant human subject.

- Faces act as architectural forms rather than characters
- Foreground framing used to compress and isolate the subject
- Atmospheric separation to layer depth
- Composition designed to feel surreal and unsettling

This scene pushes the project toward a more symbolic and artistic direction.

## 📸 Renders & Cinematics

All renders and animated shots are captured directly from Unreal Engine using **Movie Render Queue**, with no external compositing.

The focus is on:
- Clean silhouettes
- Intentional framing
- Slow, deliberate camera movement

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Lighting and exposure can communicate mood without complex assets
- Scale is most effective when contrasted against a single human reference
- Fog and atmosphere are essential for selling depth in large environments
- Restrained color palettes create stronger emotional impact than high variation

---

## 🚧 Project Status

✅ Environment layouts finalized  
✅ Lighting and atmosphere pass completed  
✅ Cinematic cameras established  
🔧 Ongoing refinement of materials and shot composition  

---

## 📁 Repository Notes

- Large assets managed using **Git LFS**
- Standard Unreal Engine 5 project structure
- Project optimized for cinematic presentation and visual fidelity

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **fan-inspired environment project** created for educational and portfolio purposes.

All visual inspiration is drawn from *Blade Runner 2049*. No official or proprietary assets are used.
